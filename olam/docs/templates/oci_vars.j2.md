# oci_vars.j2 Documentation

## Purpose & Overview

Renders a YAML variables file with the current OCI compartment, VCN, subnet ID, and subnet DNS name, enabling repeatable and portable automation.

## When to Use

Include or render this file before automation that creates, moves, or destroys cloud resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).

## Key Variables & Inputs

- my_compartment_id, my_vcn_id, my_subnet_id, my_subnet_domain_name — dynamically provided as facts or task vars.

## Task Breakdown

- No logic; direct mapping/substitution for dynamic config
- Makes all required OCI reference values available for downstream tasks, teardown, HA

## Dependencies & Relationships

- Generated by create_instance.yml and other workflow plays.
- Used by block.yml, build.yml, and network/teardown tasks.

## Output/Result

- YAML include_vars file with dynamic, consistent cloud IDs for automation.
