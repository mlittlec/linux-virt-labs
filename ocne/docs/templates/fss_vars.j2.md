# fss_vars.j2 Template Documentation

## Purpose

Dynamically generates a YAML variable file exposing all required connection parameters for the OCI File Storage Service (FSS) provisioned by automation. Makes IDs and addresses available to other playbooks and templates.

## How the Template is Used

- Rendered by create_fss.yml as `fss_vars.yml`.
- This vars file is then included by fss_deployments.yml and any other playbooks/templates needing FSS state.
- Enables dynamic, environment-specific binding of PersistentVolumes via Jinja2 substitution.

## Key Variables & Substitutions

- `file_system_id`: The OCID for the created FSS file system.
- `mount_target_ip_address`: The primary private IP assigned to the FSS mount target.
- `export_path`: The NFS export path provisioned by the FSS export.

These values are substituted by Ansible when create_fss.yml is run, coming from OCI provision module outputs.

## Rendered Example

```yaml
file_system_id: ocid1.filesystem.oc1..aaa
mount_target_ip_address: 10.0.0.45
export_path: /fss-ocne
```

## Special Logic

- Entire template is rendered via variable substitution; no logic or conditionals.
- Used as a live config/vars file for later FSS/K8s playbooks.

## Related Files

- Generated by: create_fss.yml.
- Consumed by: fss_deployments.yml, fss_pv.j2, and subsequent FSS/NFS automation steps.
