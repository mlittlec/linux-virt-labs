# Oracle Linux Automation Manager (OLAM) Labs – Ansible Playbook Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation for each playbook and template found in `linux-virt-labs/labs/`. Each file is mapped to a Markdown `.md` file to streamline onboarding, learning, and extension.

Currently, the only included playbook is an introductory "Hello World" example.

## Playbooks – Index

| Playbook | Summary | Related Templates/Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [olam-hello-world.yaml](./olam-hello-world.md) | Minimal demo playbook that prints a welcome message. | (none, standalone) |

---

## Onboarding & Usage

1. **Review olam-hello-world.yaml and its `.md` documentation**
2. Use as a starting point for new Ansible playbooks or Oracle Linux Automation Manager (OLAM) workflows in this lab directory.
3. Expand with additional lab playbooks or templates as needed. For each, create a matching Markdown `.md` file in this directory for future developers/operators.

---

## Best Practices

- Each Ansible playbook or Jinja2 template should always have a corresponding `.md` documentation file here.
